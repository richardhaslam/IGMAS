1. Scope of application
(1) These License Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) apply for the contractual relation between GFZ and entitled users which have registered following the Registration process (see clause 2) (“USER”).
(2) These Terms govern the USER’s acquisition and use of IGMAS+-software in executable form, any updates as well as the respective documentation/user Manual ("Software") as provided by GFZ as download on the website www.gfz-potsdam.de/igmas (“Website”), e-mail: igmas@gfz-potsdam.de.
2. Registration
(1) The USER needs to register on the Website to be able to download the Software.
(2) There are two types of licenses from which the USER has to choose one when registering: a personal individual single-user license ("Personal License") and a group multi-user license ("Group License"). The scope of the Licenses is defined as license grant in clause 4.
a. The Personal License is issued to a single person and is non-transferable. In case the USER needs licenses for several persons, a separate registration form needs to be filled in by each person or a Group License needs to be requested.
b. The Group License is issued to an entity like a research institute, a university or a company to be used by their employees as well as their onsite working exchange scientists as entitled multi-users, but only for own internal research, educational or commercial purposes of the registered entity.
(3) The USER is responsible for ensuring that his device meets the requirements to work with the Software.
3. Term, Termination
(1) The license runs for one year, starting on the day of submitting the registration form by the USER (see clause 2(1)), and is automatically terminated after one year. To use the software after one year, the USER needs to request a new license again by new registration on the Website. The Software will notify the User about the approaching end of the license in advance.
(2) Extraordinary termination rights for important reasons remain unaffected.
4. License Grant
(1) Depending on the USER’s chosen option at his registration (see clause 2(1)), GFZ hereby grants the USER either a Personal License (single-user for an individual, non-transferable) or a Group License (multi-user license for an entity; entitled multi-users are employees as well as onsite working exchange scientists and guests of the registered entity).
(2) Personal License and Group License are non-sublicensable and non-exclusive. Both types of Licenses allow the USER to install and use the Software in executable form by the USER himself (Personal License) or the USER’s entitled multi-users (Group License) on the USER’s devices under USER’s control in accordance with these Terms, but only for own internal research, educational or commercial purposes of the USER.
(3) The USER is not permitted to:
